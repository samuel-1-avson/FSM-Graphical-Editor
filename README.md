# FSM Designer

FSM Designer is a graphical desktop application for creating, editing, and simulating Finite State Machines (FSMs). Built as an intuitive drag-and-drop tool, it helps engineers, students, and researchers design and visualize FSMs for embedded systems, software modeling, digital logic, and more.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 **Visual FSM Editing**: Drag and drop states and transitions on a canvas.
- ⚙️ **Interactive Simulation**: Simulate your FSM step-by-step and observe state transitions.
- 💾 **Save/Load Designs**: Export FSMs for later editing or sharing.
- 🧠 **Custom Event and State Labels**: Define specific transitions, events, and actions.
- 🧱 **Code Generation (Planned)**: Generate code in C/C++ or Python for microcontroller and software projects.
- 💻 **Cross-platform GUI**: Built with PyQt5 for a responsive and modern user experience.
